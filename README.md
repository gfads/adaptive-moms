# Adaptive Messaging Systems

This project explores the use of control theory to implement and tune controllers, such as classical PID, variants of PID and unconventional controllers drawn from cloud computing 
and network control flow. These controllers are used to fine-tune the behaviour of [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
